UI tests can't tap on regular UIView

Summary:
See example app. A regular UIView exposed to UIAccessibility with userInteraction enabled can't be tapped. While this makes little sense in this example, it does make sense in actual apps that have a UITapGestureRecognizer assigned to the view.

Steps to Reproduce:
1. Download example project
2. Decompress example project
3. Run UI test of example project


Expected Results:
The test passes. The XCUIElement should exist and should be tappable.

Actual Results:
The test fails. The XCUIElement exists but is not tappable.
